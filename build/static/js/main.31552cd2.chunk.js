A second pointer would then start iterating through all the multiples of 2 and crossing them off since any multiple would be considered composite. This process then happens for 3. However, once it gets to 4, it would've already been crossed off as composite since when the algorithm ran for 2, 4 was detected as a mutiple of 2. So, the pointer then skips to 5. The process keeps going until we hit ",Object(c.jsx)("i",{children:"n"}),".
